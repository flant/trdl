            <p>Continuous delivery via the CI system works well for the SaaS model, that is, for software hosted on cloud servers. At the same time, you would be hard-pressed to find a tool that is as fast at delivering code to user devices.</p>

            <div class="card__title block__subtitle">Challenges related to implementing a secure delivery</div>
            <p>You may encounter the following challenges in trying to deliver software securely:</p>
            <ul class="card__list">
              <li class="card__item">A single GPG signature is not enough. (What if the developer's laptop has been hacked?) You will need a quorum-based system for accepting the code and signing the built binary files.</li>
              <li class="card__item">The acceptance system should not depend on human errors, such as the bus factor, regulation violations, misclicks, etc.</li>
              <li class="card__item">At the same time, even the most complex system can fail.</li>
              <p><span>Example</span>:  The release must be approved by three developers: a product owner, a security officer, and some other person. However, the acceptance system's administrator has privileges to sign the release for all of them.</p>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <div class="card__title block__subtitle">Package manager limitations</div>
            <p class="">There are many package managers, but they all have common drawbacks:</p>
            <ul class="card__list">
              <li class="card__item">each platform requires its own manager;</li>
              <li class="card__item">the package creation process is complicated;</li>
              <li class="card__item">there is a lot of manual work involved: the user has to add the package source, find the package, and install/upgrade/uninstall it.</li>
            </ul>
